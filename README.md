1. [First Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component)

* React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app.
* In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.
* React components are regular JavaScript functions except:
    - Their names always begin with a capital letter.
    - They return JSX markup.
